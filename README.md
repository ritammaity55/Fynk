## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install  # or yarn install or pnpm install
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and populate it with the required environment variables (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section).

4. **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev  # or yarn dev or pnpm dev
    ```

    This will start the Next.js development server. The application should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you configured).

## Features

- 🚀 **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with Next.js App Router, Postgres, Prisma, Clerk & TypeScript.

- 📡 **API Integration:** Uses Route Handlers for seamless API communication.
- 🔄 **Data Fetching, Caching & Revalidation:** Ensures optimal performance.
- 🎭 **Client & Server Components:** Smart separation of responsibilities.
- 🛣️ **Dynamic & Static Routes:** Flexible routing system.
- 🎨 **Styling with Tailwind & Shadcn:** Beautiful and responsive UI.
- 🔒 **Authentication & Authorization:** Secure user management with Clerk.
- 📤 **File Uploads with UploadThing:** Easy media handling.
- 🗃️ **Database Integration with Prisma:** Scalable and efficient database interactions.
- 🚀 **Server Actions & Forms:** Enhanced form management and submission.
- ⚡ **Optimistic Updates:** Improves user experience with instant UI feedback.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js (App Router)**
- **React**
- **PostgreSQL (via Prisma ORM)**
- **Clerk (for authentication & authorization)**
- **UploadThing (for file uploads)**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS & Shadcn (for styling)**

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<your_clerk_publishable_key>
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=<your_clerk_secret_key>
DATABASE_URL=<your_database_url>
UPLOADTHING_TOKEN=<your_uploadthing_token>
```

**Important:** Sensitive keys should *never* be exposed in client-side code. Keep them securely stored in your server environment.

## Security Considerations

- **Server-Side Authentication:** Clerk handles authentication securely on the server side, ensuring sensitive credentials remain hidden.
- **Environment Variables:** Sensitive API keys and secrets are stored securely in the `.env.local` file and excluded from version control (`.gitignore`).

## Frontend Implementation

The frontend is built using Next.js with Server Components for efficient rendering. Layouts and Route Handlers ensure a structured and maintainable application flow. Styling is done using Tailwind CSS and Shadcn for a clean and responsive UI.

## Backend Implementation

- **Database:** Prisma ORM manages database interactions with PostgreSQL.
- **Authentication:** Clerk handles user authentication and authorization.
- **API Routes:** Next.js Route Handlers are used for backend API communication.
- **File Uploads:** UploadThing is integrated for seamless media handling.

## Deployment

You can deploy this Next.js application to any platform that supports Node.js and Next.js, such as **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or **AWS**. Ensure that environment variables are properly configured on your deployment platform.
